# Hearts of Competition

Hearts of Competition is a web app for managing campaigns in a popular strategic game Hearts of Iron IV.
Project uses PHP 8.0 with MVC architecture for backend and MySQL as a database. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery are used in frontend. And Composer is used to manage dependencies.  
Despite the project is still being developed, it can already be used to:
- Create a new campaign and manage joined players.
- See list of available campaigns and join one.

Future functions to be developed:
- Mechanism to update or edit campaigns (for now, owner of the campaign can only delete the campaign).
- User profiles.
- Rating of players and managers of campaigns.

## How to try this web app?
For now, you will need to import the project files into a directory with PHP 8.0, Apache and MySQL server (preferrably WAMP or XAMPP).
Then you need to install all the dependencies via Composer.
